                        technology
                        graduates who are well equipped to handle the challenges of the nation in the 21st century.
                        IIT Jodhpurâ€™s curriculum is designed to provide students a unique blend of strong technical
                        knowledge, personality development skills and leadership qualities so that they evolve as
                        complete
                        well-rounded individuals. We have revamped our Placement section to Student Career Development
                        Center
                        (SCDC) with the objective to make every IITJ student a career oriented individual not a job
                        oriented
                        person. With this new initiative SCDC ensures an encouraging atmosphere for students by
                        providing
                        them ample opportunities to build competencies in sync with dream careers through various career
                        development activities. We are providing several services and resources that assist students in
                        their ongoing effort of competence mapping, career planning and employer searching. The prime
                        goal
                        of SCDC is to encourage students to adhere to positive attitude, discipline and perseverance and
                        to prepare them for their future in a best possible way.

                        for our constant growth and also cordially invite you all in our brand new campus with latest
                        state-of-the-art facilities for the upcoming placement season 2018-19. We also encourage
                        companies
                        to share their requirements in different facets of industrial problems and engage in the mutual
                        exploration of opportunities with regard to association with academic experts in cutting-edge
