                    developing exciting solutions to problems in the Industry as well as in the Academia.
                    Creativity is sustained and kindled in the students through a large number of
                    competitions organized by students in the spheres of technology, arts and
                    management thereby providing for the holistic development of the individual. This is

                <b>Training</b>
                <p>
                    We believe that our students should be able to adapt, adopt and become adept in
                    their technical and life skills to survive in the industry. Hence, the students are
                    trained by highly qualified corporate trainers who focus on both Aptitude and Soft
                    skills. Our students draw their own ‘Aspirations Chart’ so that they can present their
                    Achiever Pattern in their resumes. This includes academic credentials, smart
                    thinking, communication skills, problem solving ability and technical competencies.
