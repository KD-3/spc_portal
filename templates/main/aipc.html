                    term association, the AIPC has indicated the following guidelines to the recruiters. All the

                <ol>
                    <li><b>PPOs:</b> In order to have a mutual benefit, it is highly desirable that the status of the
                        PPOs be informed by the last week of August. This is for students selected for intern through on
                        campus internship hiring process by the recruiters and after successful completion of the
                        internship.

                    <br>
                    <li><b>Short listing as well as selection criteria: </b>If a company has any reservation to
                        shortlist / accepts students with arrears/backlogs, the company needs to inform the same in
                        advance in the job notification form. The company should clearly spell these criterions in the
                        job notification form such as: active/ cleared backlogs, year gap, bond, medical fitness
                        parameters etc.
                    </li>
                    <br>

                    <li><b>Requirement on bond:</b> If the policy of a company requires signing a bond as part of the
                        joining, it is highly desirable to specify clearly at the time of registration (on the
                        registration portal in the JNF).
                    </li>
                    <br>

                    <li><b>Representation during the Pre-assessment tests:</b> At least one representative from the
                        company and/ or on behalf of the company should be present in the campus during pre-assessment
                        tests.
                    </li>
                    <br>

                    <li><b>Medical tests and Visa:</b> Regarding medical tests and visa delay issues, it will be
                        beneficial that the recruiter informs students in advance through Placement/CDC/CCD office.
                    </li>
                    <br>

                    <li><b>Time duration:</b> The maximum time for any pre-assessment test (online or off-line) is 90
                        minutes. Under certain exceptional cases another 30 minutes may be considered. For a single
                        company, a student can appear for personal interview for a maximum of two hours which must
                        include multiple sessions along with break in between and no single session can go beyond 45
                        minutes.
                    </li>
                    </br>

                    <li>The placement test should be held on campus under the supervision of respective placement
                        office. Generic tests like hackathon, code challenge, case competition, buddy session etc. will
                        not be recognized as placement process and a company cannot recruit through these means as a
                        part of official campus placement.
